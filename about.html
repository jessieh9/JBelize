	<h2>Why create this website?</h2>
	<p>I feel as though many people are unaware of the vast amount of resources that are available on the internet which
		can be used to their greatest advantage. Education is a growing necessity that many may not have the access to.
		I believe that every person has a desire to learn, but some may not necessarily know where to begin their
		journey of learning. </p>

		created this page in attempt to practice my coding skills and hopefully start a real project towards benefitting
		my country.
